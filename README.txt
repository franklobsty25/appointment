Applicants or users first must register with their info before logging to their dashboad to schedule an appointment.
Applicants or users can make changes to password if need arises.
Applicants or users can comment on appointment attended to.

Admin must also login in to his/her dashboad.
Admin can view comments and make changes to password.
Admin login credentials must be inputted into the system or server by default.
That is, the admin field is a boolean and set to false by default and must be change to true after registering to enable the admin login to the dashboard of the system.

Default sample admin inseted into the system is email: peter.enimil@233developers.com pass: peter.
It can changed or new one created.
